Version="1.0 (29-Nov-2025)"
License="MIT (https://opensource.org/license/mit)"
ShortDesc="The 'QBDS' library defines some common constants and routines shared across all QBDS libraries. You never need a $USELIBRARY call for this, as this library is always automatically pulled in by each of the other QBDS libraries (dependency). However, if you quickly need to lookup a constant name, you can do it here ('Show Docs' button)."
