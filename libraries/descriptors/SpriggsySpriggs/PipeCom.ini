ShortDesc="PipeCom is a cross-platform library (Windows & POSIX (Mac & Linux)) for QB64-PE that allows capturing of the stdout & stderr streams and the exit code of a SHELL'ed process without the need to redirect the output into a temp file and then reading the result back from there. Instead PipeCom is able to directly return the output in the specified string variable."
