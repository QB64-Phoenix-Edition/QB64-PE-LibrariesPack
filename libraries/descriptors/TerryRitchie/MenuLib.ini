ShortDesc="This is a fixed and slighly enhanced revision of Terry Ritchie's Menu Library, done by RhoSigma (Roland Heyder). It now operates on any legacy or _NEWIMAGE graphic screen and also allows to redefine the menus now. As usual, the programmer can design a custom menu theme through a myriad of commands that control color, size, font, text location, menu and sub-menu location and 2D/3D look and feel. In the documentation pay attention to the various yellow and red revision annotations."
