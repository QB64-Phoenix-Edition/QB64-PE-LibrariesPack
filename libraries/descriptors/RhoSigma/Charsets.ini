ShortDesc="If you are a foreign QB64-PE user who needs to use another codepage than the standard Pc437, then this library is for you. While it's easy to switch the IDE codepage in the options, your programs must always manually remap all 128 codepoints. This library now has a simple command to perform the switch and do all required unicode remapping. Additionally the library offers various functions to convert any text or unicode sequences to UTF-8, ready to be used with QB64-PE's _UPRINT... fucntions."
