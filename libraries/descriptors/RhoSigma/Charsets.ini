ShortDesc="This library is for foreign QB64-PE users who need to use another codepage than the standard Pc437. While it's easy to switch the IDE codepage in the options, the made programs must always manually remap all 128 codepoints. This library provides a simple routine to perform the switch and do all required unicode remapping. The library also has various functions to convert any text or unicode sequences to UTF-8, ready to be used with QB64-PE's _UPRINT... fucntions."
