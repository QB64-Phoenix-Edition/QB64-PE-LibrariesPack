Version="2.1 (14-Nov-2018)"
License="Public Domain (https://unlicense.org/)"
ShortDesc="Various polygon functions based on algorithms and code samples described by Darel Rex Finley under the 'Geometry/Math' chapter on his web site http://alienryderflex.com/tutorials.shtml, go there to learn more about it. Note that in my implementation I've limited the polygon corner coordinates to integers, as this library is intended for drawing on screen, not for theoretical exact math."
