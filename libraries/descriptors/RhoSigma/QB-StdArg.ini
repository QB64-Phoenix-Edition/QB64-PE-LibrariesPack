ShortDesc="The routines in this library provide the interface to setup a variable arguments list (va_list) within a regular QB64 string. Such va_list parameters are used by many C/C++ functions (eg. stdio functions). Once setup, any va_list remains valid and keeps all its values until it is freed again, hence you don't need to worry about typical BASIC language issues such as strings moving in memory or temporary values."
