Just a small example library to show how everything is organized in the new
'libraries' folder. Library authors should check the examples to learn what
library parts must go into which include files, the regular user learns how
to use the libraries with the new $USELIBRARY metacommand.

For a real library you would find the documentation here. Whether this is
a simple textfile a PDF, Markdown or HTML depends on the library author's
personal habits and preferences.
