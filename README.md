# The QB64-PE Libraries Pack
This repository is a new add-on package for **QB64-PE v4.3.0 and up**, it contains selected user libraries from which we think they are worth to be distributed as an dedicated package.

Simply download the **Source code** archive from the [latest release](https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64-PE-LibrariesPack/releases/latest), unpack it and then drop both, the `libraries` and the `LibExpSource` folders right into your QB64-PE main folder.

For later convenience you should now first build the **LibraryExplorer** application, do so by loading the `LibraryExplorer.bas` source from the `LibExpSource` folder into the IDE and compile it via the F11 key (Make EXE only). Look at the IDE status area to see where the executable was saved. If it's in your QB64-PE main folder then it's Ok, otherwise please move the executable manually into the QB64-PE main folder. After successful compiling you no longer need the `LibExpSource` folder and you can safely delete it again, if you want.

For more information on the **Libraries Pack** and its usage please click into the `libraries` folder in the listing above and look at the README file there.
