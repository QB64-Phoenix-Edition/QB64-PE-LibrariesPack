# The QB64-PE Libraries Pack
This repository is a new add-on package for **QB64-PE v4.3.0 and up**, it contains selected user libraries from which we think they are worth to be distributed as an dedicated package.

Simply download the **Source code** archive from the [latest release](https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64-PE-LibrariesPack/releases/latest), unpack it and then drop both, the `libraries` and the `LibraryExplorer` folders right into your QB64-PE main folder.

After that load the `LibraryExplorer.bas` source into the IDE and compile it, but first switch off the "Output EXE to Source Folder" option, or otherwise move the executable out of the source folder after compiling and drop it in the QB64-PE main folder. After successful compiling you no longer need the `LibraryExplorer` folder and you may delete it, if you want.

For more information click into the `libraries` folder in the listing above and look at the README there.
